//What did I learn and what did I already know?

//More or less everything involving classes was new for me, although I have worked a bit wit them prior I never understood how they worked, I simply implemented code friends gave me or I found on the internet.
//Most other things were either copy-pasting code or implementing already known teqniques


//What was dificult and how was that dificulty overcome?

//Trying to implement classes in other source and header files than where the main exists, it was solved by looking back at previous asignments where files were linked. With some googleing I found how you are
//supposed to call classes from other files


//What could be improved?

//On my end is quite obvious, the first task has quite an ugly way of creating and changing what vehicle you are editing. I also didn't get to all the optional tasks, mostly due to me studying 150% and simply
//not having the time. On the part of the lab, it is quite weirdly paced, with you having to learn everything for task 1 and then having to use parts of that knowledge for later tasks, the first tasks feels
//more like the last, and the later tasks being very simple
